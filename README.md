This Thesis work is based on Prediction of Financial Stock price prediction using Deep learning techniques

We propose an ensemble model of CNN-BiLSTM and a modified Trans-
former (incorporating temporal effect of stocks) which will be predicting stock prices of
two IT companies: Amazon and Facebook. Performance metric taken are Root Mean
Square Error(RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We have done analysis on en-
semble CNN-BiLSTM and on Transformer model. The performance has been analysed
by finding the RMSE and MAE scores for each of the above models and concluded that
minimum score in both the metric has been obtained in Transformer model.
